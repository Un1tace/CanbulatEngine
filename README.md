## What is this?
This is a open source game engine made by me. This is a C# project for my NEA for computer science and as a nice little project. This is made to make making games for begineer develops easier, showing them how logic, mathematics and all the functions works meaning there is a visual programming language.

A lot of the stuff is still being implemented as it has been started recently and many functions do not work! I am actively working to finish this so in the mean time have a look at the code.
